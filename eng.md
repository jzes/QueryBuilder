# Query Builder

In some use cases where we come across a legacy database or the database where we working is full of business rules and does not have any documented roles or entities, we can face a challenge and end with a technical debt if decide to use an ORM(Object Relational Mapping) solution like Entity Framework.
To avoid this we ended writing SQL code in our application code and this is a dirty solution, to keep away from this Query Builder was started

## How to use

In a no distant future Query Builder will be able downloaded from [nuget](http:\\nuget.org) and then we'll have more explanations of how to use it.
